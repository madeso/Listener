Listener is a simple C++ api for detecting speech on computers.It's aimed to be a cross-plattform customizable library that can easily be integrated in existing games.

Currently speech detection supported backends:
* Sapi for windows
* ? for osx
* ? for *nix systems
* Null backend as a fallback

My current setup is not optimized for speech recognition (so testing is hard) and the library is in currently in a alpha state and currently isn't ready for usage just yet.
